## Features:

- URL routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- URL parameters
- Static file serving
- JSON parsing
- Pluggable middleware

## Swift version
The latest version of Kitura works with the DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-03-24-a version of the Swift binaries. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/). Compatibility with other Swift versions is not guaranteed.

## Installation (Docker development environment)

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your development system and start a Docker session/terminal.

2. From the Docker session, pull down the [kitura-ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/kitura-ubuntu/) image from Docker Hub:

  `docker pull ibmcom/kitura-ubuntu:latest`

3. Create a Docker container using the `kitura-ubuntu` image you just downloaded:

  `docker run -i -t ibmcom/kitura-ubuntu:latest /bin/bash`

4. From within the Docker container, execute the `clone_build_test_kitura.sh` script to build Kitura and execute the test cases:

  `/root/clone_build_test_kitura.sh`

  The last output line from executing the `clone_build_test_kitura.sh` script should be similar to:

  `>> Finished execution of tests for Kitura (see above for results).`

5. You can now run the KituraSample executable inside the Docker container:

  `/root/start_kitura_sample.sh`

  You should see a message that says "Listening on port 8090".

## Installation (Vagrant development environment)

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

3. From the root of the Kitura folder containing the `vagrantfile`, create and configure a guest machine:

 `vagrant up`

4. SSH into the Vagrant machine:

 `vagrant ssh`

5. As needed for development, edit the `vagrantfile` to setup [Synced Folders](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/basic_usage.html) to share files between your host and guest machine.

6. Now you are ready to develop your first Kitura App. Check [Kitura Sample](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Sample) or see [Developing Kitura applications](#developing-kitura-applications).

## Installation (OS X)

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (if you don't already have it installed):

 `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

 `brew install http-parser curl hiredis`

3. Download and install the [supported Swift compiler](#swift-version).

 After installing it, make sure you update your PATH environment variable as described in the installation instructions (e.g. export PATH=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin:$PATH)

4. Now you are ready to develop your first Kitura App. Check [Kitura Sample](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Sample) or see [Developing Kitura applications](#developing-kitura-applications).

## Installation (Linux, Apt-based)

1. Install the following system linux libraries:

 `sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool libkqueue-dev libkqueue0 libdispatch-dev libdispatch0 libhttp-parser-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libhiredis-dev libbsd-dev`

2. Install the [supported Swift compiler](#swift-version) for Linux.

 Follow the instructions provided on that page. After installing it (i.e. uncompressing the tar file), make sure you update your PATH environment variable so that it includes the extracted tools: `export PATH=/<path to uncompress tar contents>/usr/bin:$PATH`. To update the PATH env variable, you can update your [.bashrc file](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html).

3. Clone, build and install the libdispatch library.
The complete instructions for building and installing this library are  [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/blob/experimental/foundation/INSTALL), though, all you need to do is just this
 `git clone -b experimental/foundation https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch.git && cd swift-corelibs-libdispatch && git submodule init && git submodule update && sh ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-swift-toolchain=<path-to-swift>/usr --prefix=<path-to-swift>/usr && make && make install`

4. Now you are ready to develop your first Kitura App. Check [Kitura Sample](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Sample) or see [Developing Kitura applications](#developing-kitura-applications).

## Developing Kitura applications
Let's develop our first Kitura Web Application written in Swift!

1. First we create a new project directory

  ```bash
  mkdir myFirstProject
  ```

2. Next we initialize this project as a new Swift package project

  ```bash
  cd myFirstProject
  swift build --init
  ```

  Now your directory structure under myFirstProject should look like this:
  <pre>
  myFirstProject
  ├── Package.swift
  ├── Sources
  │   └── main.swift
  └── Tests
      └── <i>empty</i>
  </pre>

  Note: For more information on the Swift Package Manager, go [here](https://swift.org/package-manager)

3. Now we add Kitura as a dependency for your project (Package.swift):

  ```swift
  import PackageDescription

  let package = Package(
      name: "myFirstProject",
      dependencies: [
          .Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 9)
      ])
  ```

4. Import the modules in your code (Sources/main.swift):

  ```swift
  import Kitura
  import KituraNet
  import KituraSys
  ```
5. Add a router and a path:

  ```swift
  let router = Router()

  router.get("/") {
  request, response, next in
      response.send("Hello, World!")
      next()
  }
  ```

6. Create and start a HTTPServer:

  ```swift
  let server = HttpServer.listen(8090, delegate: router)
  Server.run()
  ```

7. Sources/main.swift file should now look like this:

  ```swift
  import Kitura
  import KituraNet
  import KituraSys

  let router = Router()

  router.get("/") {
  request, response, next in
      response.send("Hello, World!")
      next()
  }

  let server = HttpServer.listen(8090, delegate: router)
  Server.run()
  ```

8. Compile your application:

  - Mac OS X: `swift build -Xcc -fblocks -Xswiftc -I/usr/local/include -Xlinker -L/usr/local/lib`
  - Linux:  `swift build -Xcc -fblocks`

  Or copy [Makefile and build scripts](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CI/blob/master/build) to your project directory and run `make build`. You may want to customize this Makefile and use it for building, testing and running your application. For example, you can clean your build directory, refetch all the dependencies, build, test and run your application by running `make clean refetch test run`.

9. Now run your new web application:

  ```
  .build/debug/myFirstProject
  ```

10. Open your browser at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

## Kitura Wiki
Feel free to visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/wiki) for our roadmap and some tutorials.

## Developing Kitura

1. Clone this repository, `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura`
2. Build and run tests
  `make test`

 ### Notes
 * Homebrew by default installs libraries to `/usr/local`, if yours is different, change the path to find curl and http-parser libraries, in `Kitura-CI/build/Makefile`:
 
   ```Makefile
   SWIFTC_FLAGS = -Xswiftc -I/usr/local/include
   LINKER_FLAGS = -Xlinker -L/usr/local/lib
   ```
